/**
 * OPD or "Oggle Platform Demo" is a SUPER stripped back version of Oggle's
 * internal EngineManager subsystem, created purely for the purposes of demoing
 * various aspects of the platform, live on the home page of the main website.
 * The demoed features will be initially constrained to the loading of various
 * device meshes and their dynamic customization i.e loading video/image screens
 * changing the device colour/opacity,etc.
